Dancing Biped Robot GUI

Components: 1)Itsy Bitsy M4 Express
            2)TFT LCD 
            3)Servo motors 
            4)Ultrasonic sensor 
            5)Buzzer 
            6)Keypad 
            7)RGB module
         
Introduction:
Our team has made a dancing robot GUI. The robot is controlled through a keypad and ultrasonic sensor. We have created an FSM that
that controls 9 different states of the robot. We have a demo state that executes the minimum requirements and will be used during
evaluation in the lab.

Additional Functionalities:
1)Addded buzzer for songs
2)Synchronized dances with 6 different songs
3)Keypad for password
4)Keypad to access other states of the FSM
5)Keypad and Ultrasonic sensor for interrupts and wall detection
6)Animation of loading text
7)Added group logo
8)Made animation/gif for dances
9)RGB module used for user friendly inteface: indicates when a key is pressed and when FSM is in a particular state
